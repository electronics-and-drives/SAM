# SAM
E&D Skill Application Manager (SAM)

The SKILL Application Manager (SAM), is a new tool for Cadence Virtuoso that assists SKILL programmers in software development. This tool allows a very user-friendly organization and execution of source code. Using SAM the manual effort is reduced and many errors are avoided. Additionally, its powerful GUI allows a much more comfortable way of developing userware than the usage of command lines. We successfully applied SAM on our practical programming courses at Reutlingen University.
