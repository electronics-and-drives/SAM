*	SKILL Application Manager Initializing File (.saminit)
*
*	Purpose:	This File can be used as a part of the SKILL
*				Application Manager (SAM) to customize the GUI
*				of Cadence Viruoso. Loading this file to the
*				Viruoso Command Interpreter Window (CIW) adds
*				a menu item "Open rbzSAM" to the toolbar menu
*				item "Tools" of the CIW. Therefor you have to
*				enter the correct path to your rbzSAM.il code
*				file in the following. Loading the .saminit
*				file could be done in the .cdsinit file.
